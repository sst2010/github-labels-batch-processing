# [Labels I Use](#)

After some research about efficient labels to use in GitHub, I created my own set of labels combining various architectures from multiple articles. Below is a snapshot of those labels and a JSON you can use with the scripts in this repo. to create those labels.

## Warning !!

- The JSON below can ONLY be used to create those labels.
- To update or transform your existing labels, refer to the update script and modify the JSON accordingly.
